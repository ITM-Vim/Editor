# IT Masters: Vim IDE

> Vim is a Unix text editor that's included in Linux, BSD, and macOS. It's
> known for being fast and efficient, in part because it's a small application
> that can run in a terminal (although it also has a graphical interface), but
> mostly because it can be controlled entirely with the keyboard with no need
> for menus or a mouse. For instance, to insert text into a file, you press I
> and type. To navigate or to issue a command (such as Save, Backspace, Home,
> End, and so on), you press Esc on your keyboard and then press whatever key
> or key combination corresponds with the action you want to take. It's a very
> different way of editing text compared to what modern computer users expect,
> but it's the way Unix admins all over the world edit config files,
> changelogs, scripts, and more.
>
> Vim is also commonly referred to as Vi because when it was written by Bill
> Joy in the late 1970s, it was short for visual editor. Before Vi, few people
> even imagined that a computer could act as a sort of interactive typewriter.
> Text files were edited with commands (like ed) that would find a specific
> line and either insert or remove text; literally all text was manipulated
> with what amounted to a rudimentary version of your favorite office
> application's find-and-replace menu (but without the office application). Vi
> was a breath of fresh air, enabling users to enter a screen session that
> showed them their entire file and allowed them to edit it live.
